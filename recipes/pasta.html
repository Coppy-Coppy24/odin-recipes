    <p>This dough makes really great homemade linguine or ravioli using a manual pasta machine. If the dough is too sticky, roll it in a bit of flour.
        This recipe makes enough pasta for 24 small raviolis or 4 servings of linguine. Whatever pasta you make, it should take no more than 4 to 6 minutes to boil.</p>
